                <h5>What is Blockchain</h5><br>

                <p>A Blockchain is divided into a public(permissionless) and a private(permissioned) type.  A public blockchain is a Decentralized Ledger that transacts, and stores data in a decentralized way, across many
                    computers(nodes) for anyone to publicly access that data, as opposed to traditional legacy databases that transact, process and store data in a centralized way,
                    meaning a mainframe server in a particular location.<br>
                    The difference between the two is in the case of legacy databases, data is simply inputted and saved to that central
                    point of contact,
                    left wide open to manipulation and hacks because information is easily accessible by admins and various permissioned
                    entities that may have bad intentions.
                </p>
                
                <p>Blockchain on the other hand, enhances data integrity because once data and transactions are inputted, they then go through what we call an algorithm consensus process
                    whereby the transaction/data gets put into a block of other transactions which then goes through it's rigorous consensus process of getting picked up
                    by the (nodes) on the blockchain for validation of the data to then be confirmed by the miners on the blockchain, and <em>only</em> when the data is confirmed, it gets approved and saved on the blockchain for good.
                </p>
                <p>I also have to mention that it is called a blockchain for a reason, the clue is in the the name: It is a chain of blocks
                    and each block is filled with transactions.  Each block has a unique hashed sequence(reference number)generated through the mining process(see terminoloy section)
                    which is consecutive to each block in the chain.  This means that if even just one letter or digit got changed within any block,
                    the whole chain of blocks in the entire chain would halt.<br>
                    Now you may be thinking this is no good!!
                    However, in order for that to happen, a bad actor would need to at least 51% ownership of the blockchain 
                    which is known as a 51% attack.  This means a bad actor would have to first own at minimum 51% of all the bitcoin on the blockchain(do the math),
                    and because new blocks with transactions in them are generated every 10 mins, a bad actor would still have to try and perform a malicious act on the whole chain 
                    in order to fork the network to a new chain where which the funds can then be stolen.  All inside approximately 10 mins??
                    <em>This</em> is where the impossible bit lays, even if somehow someone was rich enough to own 51% of the network in the first place.  This makes bitcoin the most secure blockchain out there, fully decentralized
                    from an architectural point.  Thus unhackable and unable to change data once it is on the blockchain.
                </p><br>

                <h6><em>Private Blockchains</h6></em>
                <p>Private permissioned blockchains are much needed and operate different mechanically.  Here, access is controlled from who can read and write,
                   to who can amend and delete.  Basically all of the features of a legacy system <em>but</em> with the exception of utilising public permissionless chains also.
                   This is an equally important feature, because as transparent as public chains are, large corporations and enterprises will want to grant access and keep private
                   parts of their system and financial data from competitors for example.  
                   Another example is that an employee should not have the same rights to information as the Directorate of a company. Here we also get quicker transaction throughputs', 
                   but this is a trde-off with security.  As a private ledger is a centralised entity, it is open for attack from bad doers.
                   Two example of a private blockchain is Hyperledger and Corda.

                <h5>What are Crypto currerncies</h5><br>

                <p>Crypto currencies are a digital form of payments also termed crypto asssets that can be used in a decentralised manner across the web. Bitcoin, which launched in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto(he, she, group of people)can be used for world-wide payments whereas other terms of cryptos are known as
                   alt-coins, short for alternative coins, or tokens which are more used as utility currency inside of a projects eco-system, for governance, staking and paying fees to use the platform whilst also fully exchangeable and trdeable.<br> 
                   Some alternative projects/coins are Solana, tezos, Polkadot and many more. Crypto currencies are cryptographic digital assets that operate on the blockchain.  A simple anology is; 
                   a liken to that we need the internet in order for us to be able to send emails, the base layer is the internet; crypto currencies base layer is the blockchain. This is where transactions and the storage of value happens just the same as any other type of data in a blockchain. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  Some cryptos have very similar features such as bitcoin and litecoin.  In fact, litecoin has the same source code as bitcoin, meaning litecoin is a fork of bitcoin at the source code level; not at the hard fork level.  Whilst other newer cryptos can operate and do more than just payments across the internet.
                  The whole point of crypto currencies is to be able to control and transact value across the internet for payments and project utility without the need for a bank or any custodial middle-men.  This cuts down on both fees and speed of transacting for the consumer.
                  If you want to send $100 abroad traditionally, this could cost up to $10 or more in fees and take days, even weeks to reach it's destination.  Now you may think; that's cheap, but
                  now imagine the fees for sending $1000, $2000 especially for third world and developing countries where literally every penny counts or $200,000 a million and beyond if you are a big corporation transacting business2business??. Such protocols as ripple and stellar are examples of targeting such markets.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Crypto currencies such as bitcoin are a free to use borderless tool that anyone with a interenet device and internet connection can use.  This puts not only the control, but the equality back into humanity, particularly when there are over 2Billion people around the world
                  who are unbanked and cut completely out of the financial economy in the deprived and under developed countries and continents around the world.  Another use-case is to buy and hold your crypto asset, providing it is a quality blue-chip such as bitcoin or ethereum.   
                  people around the world have become extremely wealthy in this fashion but it requires that you absolutely know what you are doing due to the volatility of digital assets.  If need be, seek financial advice from an expert in that field. 
                  You could also use your crypto in Defi protocols by lending it out to receive a dividend or borrowing against it in a collaterised way,  Although this does require a small amount of technical know how at this point.
                </p><br>

                <h6><em>Stable coins</em></h6>
                <p>
                  Stable coins such as tetherUSDT, USDC, BUSD and DAI are the most used stablecoiins on the blockchain. They are a base type of crypto currencies but without the volatility of original cryptos such as bitcoin.  Meaning stable coin features do not have or entail wide price swings.  instead they are either pegged to the value of $1 or pegged to a basket of
                  traditional cryptos or algorithmatic in order to maintain it's price at a dollar.  High swings to a stable coin could be anything from 0.97cents to $1.04, whereas an asset such as bitcoin could be $50,000 today and $30,000 tomorrow, almost literally.  
                  However.  Stable coins are an extremely important tool for the crypto currency eco-system, they help to keep the market a float and somewhat functioning on a base-level in terms of stability to the market because they are vital for when the crypto currency market is in a downward trend especially.  
                  For example, if you are holding bitcoin at $50,000 and the market begins to fall, you convert your bitcoins to a stable-coin and whatever price bitcoin was when you sold into a stable-coin, that would be
                  the price that is preserved regardless of how much further bitcoin falls. If bitcoin then resided at say $30,000 well guess what, you can buy up even more bitcoin than what you originally had
                  before the fall because if you exited bitcoin into stable-coin at even $47000 whilst falling from $50000, you would then now have $47000 worth of USD stable-coins to now purchase a $30000 bitcoin.
                  This is how the game is played in particular by a lot of traders. Bare in mind...trading is EXTREMELY risky, you could loose everything, but my main point is the strong role stable coins play in the eco-system.

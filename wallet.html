                    <p style="font-family:montserrat; font-size:15px; margin-left:7px;">
                        Hot wallets also known as web wallets are crypto currency wallets that store crypto and are constantly connected to the internet via a user interface, a bit like email account is constantly connected to the web.
                        These types of wallets are very useful in terms of convenience especially if you are a trader, as access is pretty instant in terms of just your password in most cases is needed and you are good to spend and send your crypto as you wish.
                        as opposed to cold storage wallets that are a lot more time consuming to access your funds, although this is the whole point and part of the security feature to cryptos stored in a cold wallet.
                        Below are some of the most trusted and commonly used hot wallets to-date.  When using these types of wallets, because they are constantly connected to the internet unlike cold wallets are, 
                        it is important to follow as best procedures as posibble in order to stay safe from potential hackers and phishing. such as procedures below is a good idea to follow:
                    </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Use secure internet</li>
                            <li>Use a VPN</li>
                            <li>Secure your devices(admin/password locks)</li>
                            <li>Keep passwords/seed phrases in a safe place</li>
                            <li>Always be sure to check the correct spelling of any wallet or website in your browser to combat phising attacks</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p style="font-family:montserrat; font-size:15px; margin-left:7px;">
                       If you do your part and stick to the physical security features noted above, hot wallets are really great tools have and use, bare in mind probably not wise to keep a large amount of your funds on them just for the added security by yourself.
                       For example, lets say you had $10,000 in crypto.  If you have this amount purely to store away as an investment, it would be wise to use a cold wallet.
                       If you had $10,000 in crypto and you are a trader, you might keep may be $3000 at time to trade with and leave the rest on a cold wallet.  This will differ from person to person and the amounts and frequencies that you are playing with
                       but you get the gist.  Below are some of the most frequently used hot wallets.<br>
                    </p>


                        <ul style="list-style: none">
                            <li>
                                Exodus<br>
                                Atomic<br>
                                Metamask<br>
                                TrustWallet<br>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        Note:<em> many blockchain projects also have their own designated wallets for their native token.</em><br><br>

                    <p style="font-family:montserrat; font-size:15px; margin-left:7px;">
                      These types of wallets on the other hand do come with great features these days such as exchanging one crypto currency for another within the wallet which allows for even greater secuurity as you do not have to send your funds to a central exchangeable
                      in order to exchange from one crypto currenct to the next, particularly useful if you are new to the crypto world and do not want to get to involved in the technicalities of moving your funds around.   
                      Another feature is a many hot wallets also now now participate and provide staking features within them which allows for light defi and interest bearing exposure.
                      There are usually charts and coin metrics that you can gather information from also.<br><br>

                      From the above list of wallets, Metamask is the main wallet protocol that will enable you to empower the whole DeFi ecosystem efficiently and sufficiently.  You can access and download Metamask via 'Google extensions' for desktop, and Google play for android.
                      Follow the instructions step by step, you will be asked to write down a 12 word keyphrase(VERY IMPORTANT) and a password.<br><br>
                      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfkqgXNPiHg">Metamask intro setup and DeFi use</a> Really good info, However. Some of the info could be a lot to initially take in but do not worry about learning everything at once.  the main objective here is to setup a metamask wallet and purchase/transfer crypto<br><br>
                       
                      Metamask can also be used in conjunction with a hardware wallet for added security.  It is also important to be aware that fees on the ethereum blockchain can be high when purchasing with your debit card or transacting to another wallet and transferring funds.
                      As of April/May 2022, the fees are significantly lower than previous months.  Let's hope this stays like this. Another point to note is that you can only send ethereum and erc20 tokens to metamask as it is an ethereum wallet.
                      If you try for example to send bitcoin, solana, cardano or any other token that is not erc20 based, you will loose your funds.  Permanently.(see terminologies for erc20 and token bases)

                <h5 style="color:black; margin:7px; font-family: montserrat;">Cold wallets</h5>
                <p style="font-family:montserrat; font-size:15px; margin-left:7px;">
                    Cold wallets also known as hardware wallets are the best form of securing your funds that you can have as unlike hot wallets, your wallet and funds are stored off-line due to the private keys being stored on the actual hardware device
                    as opposed to hot wallets where the private keys are online(stored on the web wallet).  The whole seed phrase and password situation has been to be treated just as crucial as with hot wallets because these are access to your funds as like your banking information
                    only that there is absolutely no chance of mal practice due to the off-line nature of your crypto being stored.<br>
                    There are a number of various cold/hardware wallets on the market that all have a good reputation for security and useability.  Below are the main actors in the market today:
                    
                    <ul style="list-style: none;">
                        <li>Ledger Nano</li>
                        <li>Trezor</li>
                        <li>D'cent</li>
                        <li>Ellipal</li>
                    </ul>
                    The Ledger nano and Trezor are the two earlier wallets that have been around for the last five + years, the other two are newer versions inside the last three years but all are credible devices to date.
                    all with the same common goal in mind.  They all have their unique features and bluetooth capabilities. Do some reserch.
